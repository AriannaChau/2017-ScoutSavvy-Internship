        h3 What We Do
        p Here at Inclusion, we are dedicated to sharing useful knowledge about how women and minority groups are underrepresented in the tech industry.  Using various API’s and other tools available, we want to try and start a conversation based on facts about equality in the tech workforce. We have developed a handy guide to help you learn more about where you stand in the industry, and to supply you with a way to connect with others like you. Breaking into the the tech industry can be extremely difficult, let alone if you are a woman or a minority. We believe the more facts you have available to you about certain inequalities you might be up against, the better equipped you will be to fight them and make your place in the techn world. Knowledge is power, and we are dedicated to using this knowledge to help make sure everyone feels included.
