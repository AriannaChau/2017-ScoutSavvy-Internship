Using various API’s and other tools available, we want to try and start a conversation based on facts about equality in the tech workforce. We have developed a handy guide to help you learn more about where you stand in the industry, and to supply you with a way to connect with others like you. Breaking into the the tech industry can be extremely difficult, let alone if you are a woman or a minority. We believe the more facts you have available to you about certain inequalities you might be up against, the better equipped you will be to fight them and make your place in the techn world. Knowledge is power, and we are dedicated to using this knowledge to help make sure everyone feels included. </p><h3>Lets Get Started</h3><div class="form-control"><h5>First, enter your city</h5><input id="city" type="text" placeholder="Portland, OR"/></div><div class="form-control"><h5>Next choose which jobs you are interested in</h5></div><div class="checkboxes"><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer support specialists" value="151150" id="151150"/><label for="151150">Computer support specialists</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer programmers" value="151131" id="151131"/><label for="151131">Computer programmers</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer systems analysts" value="151121" id="151121"/><label for="151121">Computer systems analysts</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Database administrators" value="151141" id="151141"/><label for="151141">Database administrators</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer hardware engineers" value="172061" id="172061"/><label for="172061">Computer hardware engineers</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer network architects" value="151143" id="151143"/><label for="151143">Computer network architects</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer &amp; information research scientists" value="151111" id="151111"/><label for="151111">Computer &amp; information research scientists</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Software developers, applications &amp; systems software" value="15113X" id="15113X"/><label for="15113X">Software developers, applications &amp; systems software</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer control programmers and operators" value="514010" id="514010"/><label for="514010">Computer control programmers and operators</label><div class="box-control"></div></div></div><div class="form-control"><h5>Now, what group are you interested in</h5></div></div><div class="graph-selections"><div class="graph-selection"><img src="/assets/images/icon-age.png" id="age"/><h4>AGE</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to learn more information about how which age groups are more likely hired for specific jobs.</p></div><div class="graph-selection"><img src="/assets/images/icon-gender.png" id="gender"/><h4>GENDER</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to learn more about gender inequality in the tech industry, and which jobs are more likely to hire a woman vs a man.</p></div><div class="graph-selection"><img src="/assets/images/icon-ethnicity.png" id="ethnicity"/><h4>ETHNICITY</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to know more about how your race/ethnicity compares to others when it comes to finding jobs in the tech industry.</p></div></div><button class="go">Go!</button></section><section id="resources-section"><h3>Resources<p>We used the <a>Meetup API</a> for our information. Below is the sources that the Meetup API gathers from, and a little information from <a>datausa</a> about each as well. </p></h3><h3>ACS<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is conducted by the US Census and sent to a portion of the population every year. Data USA does not contain the entire ACS dataset but instead relavent topics to the curated profile pages of the site. As of the 2014 (most recent) ACS release there are 1 year and 5 year estimates. Previously there was also a 3 year estimate which has now been discontinued.</p></h3><h3>ACS PUMS<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files are a set of untabulated records about individual people or housing units. The Census Bureau produces the PUMS files so that data users can create custom tables that are not available through pretabulated (or summary) ACS data products.</p></h3><h3>BEA<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes data on Input-Output also called Make-Use for industries in the United States. This Dataset is provided by the US Department of Commerce.</p></h3><h3>BLS<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a public dataset made available by the United States Department of Labor.</p></h3><h3>CHR<p>The University of Wisconsin County Health Rankings (CHR) dataset is a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.</p></h3><h3>Dartmouth Atlas<p>For more than 20 years, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented glaring variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States. The project uses Medicare data to provide comprehensive information and analysis about national, regional, and local markets, as well as individual hospitals and their affiliated physicians.</p></h3><h3>IPEDS<p>The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is the core postsecondary education data collection program for the National Center for Education Statistics, a part of the Institute for Education Sciences within the United States Department of Education.</p></h3><h3>O*Net<p>The O*Net Skills is a dataset containing detailed descriptions of the required and used skills for specific occupations. The O*Net dataset is sponsored by the United States Department of Labor. Data USA currently uses version 19.0 (July 2014) of the O*NET Database. </p></h3></section><section id="chart-section"><h3 class="search-summary">You searched for information relating to <span id="selectedChart">gender</span> in <span id="occupations">computer science</span> in the city <span id="selectedCity">Portland, OR</span>.
